# Visitor Pattern

Use the Visitor when you need to perform an operation on all elements of a complex object structure (for example, an object tree)

Use the Visitor to clean up the business logic of auxiliary behaviors.

Use the pattern when a behavior makes sense only in some classes of a class hierarchy, but not in others.

Visitor is different from strategy. Strategy pattern is used for implementing specific **algorithms** or behaviours in particular classes.
Visitor is used when we need multiple operations that may or may not be applicable for each class.

Visitor uses double dispatch to make the pattern possible.
