# Factory Pattern

Factory Method is a creational design pattern that 
provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass, 
but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.

# Use cases

When every sub classes needs their own implementations.

Sub classes do not share the implementations. 

But all have unified way of doing things.
