# Template Pattern

Template Method design pattern is a behavioral pattern that defines the skeleton of an algorithm in a base class but lets subclasses override specific steps of the algorithm without changing its structure. 

It’s particularly useful when you have a common process with variations in some of its steps.

Template Method: The method in the base class that defines the algorithm’s structure.

Concrete Methods: Methods with a defined implementation in the base class.

Abstract Methods: Methods that must be implemented by subclasses.

# Examples

Payment Flow, Report Generation such as PDF / CSV, etc.
