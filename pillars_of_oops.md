# Pillars of OOPS

1. Abstraction

Abstraction is a model of a real-world object or phenomenon,
limited to a specific context, which represents all details rele-
vant to this context with high accuracy and omits all the rest.


2. Encapsulation

Hide few behaviors and states from other objects, exposing only a limited interface to rest of program.

Use Interfaces, abstract classes.


3. Inheritence

Inheritance is the ability to build new classes on top of existing ones.


4. Polymorphism


Polymorphism is the ability of a program to detect the real class
of an object and call its implementation even when its real
type is unknown in the current context.
